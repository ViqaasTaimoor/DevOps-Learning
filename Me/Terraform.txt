- Terraform is a tool used to create servers and cloud resources automatically using code.
 - Instead of manually creating EC2, VPC, or databases in AWS console, you write a small file and Terraform builds everything for you.
 - Run one command → server gets created.

- IAC - It means managing infrastructure like servers and networks using code so environments can be created automatically and consistently.

- CloudFormation is an AWS tool used to create and manage AWS resources using a file instead of manual clicks.
 - You write a YAML or JSON file describing things like: EC2, VPC, S3, Load Balancer.
 - Run it → AWS builds everything automatically.

- Terraform is preferred over CloudFormation because it supports multiple cloud providers, while CloudFormation works only within AWS.

- Terraform was developed by HashiCorp (the same company that made Vault, Consul, etc.).

- Terraform uses HCL — HashiCorp Configuration Language.

- Terraform Registry is like an online library for ready-made Terraform code.

- Example:
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "myserver" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

- Skeleton (for flexible usage):
# provider → which cloud
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

# variables (optional inputs)
variable "instance_type" {
  default = "t2.micro"
}

# resource → what to create
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxxxx"
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}

# output → show result
output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.example.id
}

- .tf is the file extension used for Terraform configuration files.

- Commands:
 - terraform init: Prepares folder, downloads plugins. Run first always.
  - terraform init -upgrade: Updates providers/modules.
  - terraform init -reconfigure: Re-initializes setup.
 - terraform plan: Shows what Terraform will create/change (preview).
  - terraform plan -out=tfplan: Saves plan to a file.
  - terraform plan -var="name=value": Pass variable value.
 - terraform apply: Actually creates the resources.
  - terraform apply -auto-approve: Skip confirmation.
  - terraform apply tfplan: Apply saved plan file.
 - terraform destroy: Deletes everything Terraform created.
  - terraform destroy -auto-approve: Delete resources without asking.
 - terraform validate: Checks if your code has errors.
 - terraform fmt: Automatically formats Terraform configuration files to keep code clean and consistent.
 - terraform show: Displays details of current state or plan.
 - terraform output: Shows values from output block.

- Global Parameters:
 - -var="key=value": Pass variables.
 - -target=resource.name: Apply only one resource.
 - -refresh=false: Skip checking cloud state.

- A Terraform provider is the plugin that connects Terraform to a cloud or service.

- Idempotent is a concept that describes operations which produce the same result even if executed multiple times.

- .tfstate is Terraform’s state file that tracks the current infrastructure so Terraform knows what to create, change, or keep.
