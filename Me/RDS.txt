# RDS Backup and Restore

=======================

## Key Terminologies in Backup and Restore

### 1) RPO – Recovery Point Objective

**Definition:**
RPO is the **maximum acceptable data loss** measured in time.

**Explanation:**

* It is the time between the **last successful backup** and the **time of failure**.
* Example:
  Backup taken at **6:00 AM**
  Failure occurred at **7:00 AM**
  ➝ **RPO = 1 hour**
  ➝ We lose **1 hour of data**.

**Important points:**

1. Represents the **amount of data loss** a business can tolerate.
2. RPO is **defined by the business**.
3. RPO influences:

   * Backup frequency
   * Technical design
   * Disaster recovery strategy

---

### 2) RTO – Recovery Time Objective

**Definition:**
RTO is the **maximum acceptable time** required to restore service after a failure.

**Explanation:**

* It is the time between the **disaster event** and **full recovery**.
* Example:
  Disaster happened at **6:00 AM**
  Database restored by **6:30 AM**
  ➝ **RTO = 30 minutes**

**Important points:**

1. Influenced by:

   * Process
   * Staff
   * Technology
   * Documentation
2. Lower RTO requires:

   * Faster restore methods
   * Automation
   * High availability design

# RDS Backups

============

### 1) Snapshot Behavior

* First snapshot is a **full snapshot** of the used data.
* All subsequent snapshots are **incremental**:

  * Only changed data blocks are captured.

---

### 2) Manual Snapshots

* Manual snapshots:

  * Are **retained indefinitely**.
  * Remain even after DB instance is deleted.
* They must be **deleted manually** by the user.

---

### 3) Automated Snapshots

* Taken automatically by AWS.
* Include:

  * Daily snapshot
  * Transaction logs (for PITR – Point in Time Restore)

---

### 4) Backup Retention

* Automated backup retention can be set from:
  **0 to 35 days**
* If retention = 0 → backups are disabled.

---

### 5) Deleting the DB Instance

* When you delete an RDS DB:

  * You can choose to take a **final snapshot**.
  * Automated backups are deleted based on retention period.
  * Manual snapshots remain until you delete them.

- One-Line Interview Summary:
- RPO:
 - Maximum tolerable data loss in time.

- RTO:
 - Maximum tolerable downtime after failure.

- Snapshots:
 - First snapshot is full, others are incremental.

- Manual snapshots:
 - Persist even after DB deletion.

- Automated backups:
 - Retained for 0–35 days.
