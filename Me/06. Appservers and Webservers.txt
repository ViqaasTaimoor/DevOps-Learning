- Webservers: Apache (httpd), Nginx.
 - Webservers will help us manage/deploy static websites.
 - A web server is software that receives HTTP requests and serves web content to clients (browsers)
 - A static website is hosted on a web server, which simply serves pre-built files without any backend processing.

- Static Websites : A static website serves fixed content where pages are delivered exactly as stored, without server-side processing.
 -Content does not change unless the files (HTML/CSS/JS) are manually updated.
 -No database or backend logic is involved.
 -Fast, secure, and low-cost compared to dynamic websites.

- A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance, availability, and reliability.

- Difference between Apache and Nginx ?
 - Nginx is faster than Apache in terms of hosting or serving the content.
 - Nginx can be used as load balancer and no extra configuration is required.
 - Apache can also be used as load balancer but extra configurations are required.
 - Nginx is a high-performance, event-driven web server best for reverse proxy and load balancing, while Apache is process-based and more flexible for traditional web hosting.

- Apache Installation : 
 - yum install httpd
 - systemctl start httppd
 - systemctl status httpd  -l
 - ps -ef | grep httpd

- find / -name httpd.conf - for checking the httpd path.
- /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf - the default path
- Edit port number in the httpd.conf file from default 80 to your specified port number. Always take a backup first. (either copy conf file to another location or just rename it to .conf.backup and copy the entire data, paste it in a new .conf file)

- To create a static website :
 - cd /var/www/html/ (it is the default location for apache httpd, only deploy here)
 - Create a file called index.html to display a simple message.
 - <h1> your message </h1> (a basic html line).
 - check the webpage for your message.

- find / -name access_log - to find the log files path.
- /var/log/httpd/access_log - the default path for log files.
- /var/log/httpd/error_log - to check errors.

- We can run any number of Apache or Nginx servers on our instance/machine by hosting them on different port numbers.

- /usr/share/nginx/html/ - It is the default path for nginx html files.
- /etc/nginx/nginx.conf - default path for conf file, also can change port number.


- App servers: Apache Tomcat
 - An application server (app server) is software that runs your application’s backend logic and helps it talk to users, databases, and other services.
 - It is used to serve dynamic content.
 - It is a java application, so java is a pre-requisite.
 - the default filename of tomcat logs is Catalina.out and default port number is 8080.

- If no browser is available, then use curl localhost:ipaddress to check tif particular ip address is working.

- try to use /opt/ directory to download, since it is optional and good for testing.

- if systemctl is not working and you need to start apache, then go to /opt/apache tomcat/bin (example, just put the path to the installed folder of apache or any other software)
 - then use bash and startup.sh
 - bash scriptname or ./scriptname are used to start scripts.

-Deploying a sample application :
 - go to webapps directory (/opt/tomcat/webapps)
 - copy sample.war link from internet and use it with wget command

- export TMOUT=0, will keep the current session no matter the idle time.
