- Git and GitHub:
- Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files—mainly source code. Response time is much faster.
- GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It is a central repository to store source code. (GitLab, bitbucket are some alternatives).
| Git                | GitHub             |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Tool               | Platform           |
| Runs locally       | Runs online        |
| Tracks changes     | Hosts repositories |
| Works offline      | Needs internet     |
| Command-line based | Web interface      |

- Distributed Version Control. - Git
- Centralized Version Control. - SVN
- Centralized VCS has one central repository, while Distributed VCS gives every developer a complete copy of the repository and its history.
- | Feature           | Centralized          | Distributed                  |
  | ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
  | Repository copies | One                  | Multiple (each user has one) |
  | Internet needed   | Always               | Only for sharing             |
  | Speed             | Slower               | Faster                       |
  | Failure risk      | High (single server) | Low                          |
  | Branching         | Hard                 | Easy                         |
  | Offline work      | No                   |  Yes                         | 

- git init   -  make a .git repository.
- git status - Show working tree status.
- git config --list - get complete details.
- git config --global user.name " "- to register username.
- git config --global user.email " " - to register email.
- git add filename  - to track files.
- git add . - to track all files.
- git commit -m "relevant message" - to create a snapshot of the tracked files. (b112f36 is the example of commit id, used to reverse changes).'
- git log - to check logs, also useful to pull up commit id's.
- git remote -v - shows which remote repositories your local Git repo is connected to, and the URLs used for fetching and pushing.
- git remote add origin url - to add origin (fetch the repo url from GitHub by clicking on the green code button).
- git clone - helps to download all the data from central repository to local machine.
- git clone -b branchname url - to download only a specific branch.
- git pull - helps to download all the changes made in the central repository.
- git revert commit_id - to revert changes.
- git reset - resets the changes before committing.
- git branch --list - branch list.
- git branch nameofthebranch - used to create a new branch.
- git checkout branchname - used to change branches.
- git merge targetbranchname - to merge branches.
- git cherry-pick commitid - to copy specific commits from a branch.
- git commit --amend - to change the commit message, not recommended.
- git stash - used to push the added files to stash memory before commit.
- git stash list - to see the list of files in stash memory.
- git stash pop - to get files back from stash memory.
- vi  .gitignore - paste filenames in .gitignore to make git ignore the files, before committing. for security.
- git rebase -i HEAD~n - used to combine or play around with commits, always be careful.

- If someone pushed a file in the repository and you do not have it locally, then if you push without fetching the data then the push fails.
- Use Fork option to copy repositories to your account from public repos.

- Git Flow Branching Strategies :
 - Release - used for production environment.
 - Develop - used for development/staging environment.
 - Feature - used for next updates.
 - Hotfix - used to fix bugs of production.
 - Master/main - is used as a copy for release branch.

- Whenever a new branch is created then the contents of the present are copied to it. Only when creating the branch, after that any changes made are for their respective branches.

- PR --> Pull Request.
- Pull Request is used to merge two different branches. git merger is only for local while pull request is on GUI.
- Merge conflict can be seen when two identical files with same content are trying to merge. to solve just edit changes, add and commit.
