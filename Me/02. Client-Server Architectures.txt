- Client-Server Architectures are how the computer networks are structured. They are of four types :-
  - 1-Tier Architecture
  - 2-Tier Architecture
  - 3-Tier Architecture
  - N-Tier Architecture

- Types of Environments :
 - Development Environment
 - Test Environment
 - Production Environment (Live Environment)

- Client : Which requests a resource. (browser)
- Server : Which responds to that request.

- If specific resources are not available, then the website may hang, crash or become unreachable.

- Server : Hardware----> OS----> App Layer/Data Layer.

- 1-Tier Architecture : It is used only in Development Environment. We use it when we want to deploy on our local machine, eg., laptop.

- 2-Tier Architecture : The client(browser) will send request to the server. Application and database are deployed in the same machine. It is a public server, hence poses security risks.
 - If specific resources are not available, then the website may hang, crash or become unreachable.

- 1-Tier or 2-Tier architectures are seen in Dev or testing environments, not recommended for production environment.

- 3-Tier architectures are recommended for production environments.
 - has three layers:- Client, Application(Business logic) and Database layer.
 - Client Layer :- Browser.
 - Application Server :- The server which has the application hosted. It also consists the code so should be hosted on a private network for security reasons. In order for the client to access the data we need to introduce a new layer called Webserver, which will make it N-Tier Architecture. 
 - Database Server :- The server which has the DB/database hosted/stored. Must be hosted on a private network for security reasons.

- N-Tier Architectures :- Any number of layers can be added.
 - Webserver :- Used for static deployment. It is hosted on public network and has no code, only configurations for connectivity. httpd(Apache), nginx, etc,.
 - App servers :- Used for dynamic content deployment. Tomcat (Apache), jboss, weblogic.

- Browser----> Webserver-----> Application Layer-----> Database Layer. 
- Browser (x3)----> Firewall-----> Load Balancer-----> Webserver-----> Application Layer-----> Database Layer.
 - Load Balancer : Helps distribute the load coming from multiple clients between multiple Webservers. It is public

- Each server has IP address and hostname which helps all three layers to communicate with each other.
 
- IP Address :- Internet Protocol Address.
  - IPv4 : 192.168.0.0
  - IPv6 : 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334
- Hostname : Name of the server.

  
   SOA or Start of Authority ( has all the IP information)
         ^   
   Name Server (identifies the hostname using Domain)  
         ^
   Top Level Domain (.com)(checks domain name provided by Rootname Server) 
         ^   
   ROOTname Server
         ^
   Local DNS ( if the IP for hostname found, then it will send it to back to browser, if not then it send it forward)
         ^ 
- Browser/Laptop----> hostname/domain name       ( DNS : Domain Name Server, It keeps track of hostname/IP, converts hostname to IP and vice versa)
                       Netflix.com
- The above activities are entirely handled by the internet within fraction of seconds, so we don't worry about this.

- nslookup command helps fetch IP address/Domain name (eg., nslookup fb.com)
