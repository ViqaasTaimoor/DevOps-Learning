- To differentiate between a file and a directory, check permissions by using 'll' command. Directories have 'dr' in the initials.
 - drwxr-xr-x represents directory permissions
 
 - d - directory
 - r - read - 4 is the numeric value 
 - w - write - 2 is the numeric value
 - x - execute - 1 is the numeric value

- -rw-r--r-- represents file permissions

- The read, write and execute permissions are repeated  in 'drwxr-xr-x' because the first 'rwx' is for "Owner", the second would be for "Groups", the third would be for  "Others". IT represents what kind of permissions are allotted to each category. If there is a '-' instead of the permission then it means that specific permission has not been granted to that group, for example in the above directory permission 'r-x', Groups will only be able read and execute, they don't have write permission, same as Other users.
