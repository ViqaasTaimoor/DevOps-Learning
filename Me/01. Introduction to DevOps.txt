- Slack, teams,  skype, etc,. - For communication

- Jira - ticketing tool, helps team to track your progress

- Always make sure to update the ticket status.

- Tools that will  be taught :-
- Linux
- Git - used to store the code
- GitHub
- Jenkins - used for integrating
- Maven - take codes from different repositories to build a complete application.
- SonarQube
- Nexus
- Ansible
- Docker
- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- AWS Cloud

- Release :- releasing a new version for an application or a new application.

- Waterfall method :- development happens in step by step manner.
 - Requirement analysis
  - Design
   - Development
    - Testing
     - Maintenance ( done by us)
 - If any problem arises in any of the stages, the entire process restarts.
 - No communication between the client and the developer causing major delays or inconsistencies, major drawback.

- Agile Method-The client is provided with a prototype to evaluate first. Then the client provides feedback and changes will be made.
 - Continuous communication between client and developer.
 - entire process is broken down into small blocks called sprints, each sprint is of 14 days.
 - progress will be shown to client in a review meeting after a sprint, if any changes are requested then they are implemented in sprint 2, so on...
 - Daily scrum meetings will be held, we too are required to attend these.
 - Client requirements are better understood, product is delivered much faster.
 - Product is tested only on developer computers and not on production system.
 - no communication between developer and operations team.

- DevOps- Development Operations
 - helps make the software development process easy by integrating all the above mentioned tools
 - focused mostly on the operations part of the cycle.
 - Evolution of Agile methodology.
 - addresses the gap between developers and operations team.
 - Operations will monitor the application and provide feedback to the developer.
 - Software deployment and delivery is divided into 8 phases.
  - Plan
  - Code (d)
  - Build (d)
  - Testing (d)
  - Integrate (o)
  - Deploy (o)                        * d = development team
  - Operate (o)                       * o = operations team
  - Monitor (o)
 - able to identify or address the issues in the early stages which helps reduce cost, resources and even faster deployment of applications.
