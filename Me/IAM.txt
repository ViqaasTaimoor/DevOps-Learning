- IAM: Identity Access Management
 - IAM identity --> identity can be a use, group, roles.

- Policy: It defines the permissions of the IAM identity. 


- Types of policies:

- Identity Based policies:

In Line Policy: An inline policy is a policy created for a single IAM identity (a user, group, or role). 
In line policies maintain a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and an identity. 
They are deleted when you delete the identity.

- Managed Policies:
1) Aws Managed Policy
2) Customer Managed Policy

- AWS managed policies – Managed policies that are created and managed by AWS.
Customer managed policies – Managed policies that you create and manage in your AWS 
account. Customer managed policies provide more precise control over your policies 
than AWS managed policies.

- Resource-based policies:
Are attached directly to resources and specify permissions for specific actions on the resource by some principals. 

- IAM permissions boundaries:
Define the maximum permissions for an IAM entity and are used as safeguards.

- Access control lists(ACLs):
Are attached to resources and control cross-account permissions for principals from other accounts. 

- Organizations Service Control Policies(SCPs):
Specify the maximum level of permissions for an organization’s accounts. These policies are used to limit the permissions that can be assigned within member accounts.

- Session policies:
Are advanced policies used during temporary sessions for roles or federated users.

- Role:
IAM role is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions. 
It is similar to an IAM user, but is not associated with a specific person.

- Types of Roles?
 - Aws service Role: A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf.
 - AWS account: Allow entities in other AWS accounts belonging to you or a 3rd party to perform actions in this account.
 - Web identity: Allows users federated by the specified external web identity provider to assume this role to perform actions in this account.
 - SAML 2.0 federation (Security Assertion Markup Language ): Allow users federated with SAML 2.0 from a corporate directory to perform actions in this account.
 - Custom trust policy: Create a custom trust policy to enable others to perform actions in this account.

- EC2:  
- Snapshot - A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an EBS volume. You cannot use it directly — when you “launch” from a snapshot, AWS first creates a new EBS volume from it.
- EBS - Elastic Block Storage is the actual disk attached to an EC2 instance.
