- s3 - Simple Storage Service.
 - It is a Global Service. 
 - Bucket is region specific.
 - Used for fixed objects(files). Fixed means we can't edit the files in bucket, we have to download, make changes and upload.
 - Bucket name should be unique globally.
 - Bucket max size : Unlimited - You’ll never “fill” an S3 bucket — you’ll hit billing, performance, or management pain long before any size limit.
 - Object (single file) max size: 5 TB
 - Maximum single PUT upload: 5 GB
 - Multipart upload range: 5 MB – 5 GB per part (up to 10,000 parts)

- We have three different storages in AWS:
 - EBS - Elastic Block Storage - Hard disk - We can't connect multiple ec2 to single EBS.
 - s3  - Simple Storage Service - Drive Storage - We can transfer data from multiple ec2 to s3 from different regions as well.
 - EFS - Elastic File System - Can be used across different ec2


- A bucket policy is a JSON rule attached to an S3 bucket that says who can access it, what they can do, and from where.
 - ACL is at object level while Bucket Policy is at Bucket level.

- Whether an S3 object opens or downloads depends on its Content-Type and Content-Disposition metadata — not the bucket or URL.
 - S3 stores a metadata field called Content-Type. If it’s something browsers can render like text/html, image/png, image/jpeg, application/pdf: Browser displays it inline. If it’s unknown or generic like binary/octet-stream, application/zip, application/x-msdownload: Browser downloads it.
 - Content-Disposition header: This explicitly tells the browser what to do. Content-Disposition: inline → open in browser, Content-Disposition: attachment → force download.

- Re-uploading the same object key overwrites the object and its metadata, unless bucket versioning is enabled.
- We can access previous versions of the file, by going to versions tab in object details.

- Amazon S3 storage classes: Main purpose for changing class is for cost reduction.
 - S3 Standard – frequently accessed data, low latency. Examples of use: websites, APIs, active app data.
 - S3 Intelligent-Tiering – automatic cost optimization based on access. Examples for use: user uploads, shared documents, mixed workloads.
 - S3 Standard-IA – Use when data is rarely accessed but must be instantly available. Examples for use: backups, DR copies, long-term reports.
 - S3 One Zone-IA – Used when infrequent access, stored in a single AZ. Examples for use: secondary backups, non-critical logs.
 - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval – Use for archived data that still needs millisecond access. Examples for use: medical images, compliance records (rarely read).
 - S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval – Use for archives where minutes–hours retrieval is fine. Examples for use: audit logs, old backups.
 - S3 Glacier Deep Archive – Use for long-term retention where hours wait is acceptable. Examples for use: legal records, 7–10 year compliance data.

- We can edit the classes in Lifecycle rules tab.

- We can host static websites in s3 buckets by going to properties tab. Create an index and eroor .html files and uplaod, then access the url.
