Bash Scripting : Script is a set of commands which helps us to automate the process. 
- Connect to the SSH client.
- Create a test script. (vi test)
- #!/bin/bash - firt line in the script should be this. (/bin/bash is the shell).
- give a few commands. (free -m, df, ps -ef, netstat -na)
- give execute permissions to your test script.
- run using ./scriptname or bash scriptname.(bash will ignore permissions).

- Shell is the command Interpreter. It is the brain that understands the command. 
- Kernel is the core of the Operating System. Programs can never talk to the hardware directly, Kernel does it.
- Terminal takes input, shell interprets it, kernel executes it using processes, and output is returned via stdout or stderr.
- Shell ---> Kernel ---> Hardware ---> Kernel ---> Shell.
- Shell and Kernel together are called as Operating System.
- Application and Shell together are called Software.
- cat /etc/shells - to check the list of shells available. 

- few things to remember while writing scripts:
 - naming conventions
 - permissions
 - script sequence

- Absolute Path : A path that starts from the root directory (/) and shows the full location of a file or directory.
 - It is independent of your current location.
 - It works no matter where you are.
- Relative Path : A path that is relative to your current working directory.
 - It depends on where you are now.
- An absolute path starts from root and always points to the same location, while a relative path depends on the current working directory.

- Script Naming Conventions :
 - Always create a directory to store scripts.
 - Script name should identify the function.
 - Script should end with .shell (If multiple shells are used) ex: .sh, .bash.

- Script File Permissions :
 - All scripts to be executed must have execution permission enabled.

- Script Format : 
 - Define Shell (#! /bin/bash)(#! --> she bang)
 - Comments (#comments)
 - Define variables ( e.g name = Viqaas)
 - Commands (cat, rm, free -m etc.,)
 - Statements (if, while, for etc)

- use $variable to call the variable (eg: echo $a)
- The sequence for any script is top to bottom, the commands will be executed from top to bottom.
- To jump to a specific line in vi editor use :number of line.
- Make sure to add a secondary command to a real time monitoring command so that the rest of the commands in a script are executed, because it won't execute the other commands until the real time command exits. ( ex: top | grep -10)
- A variable in Bash is used to store data temporarily in memory and refer to it by name during script execution.
- A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or information passed to the program.
- The read command in Bash is used to take input from the user (stdin) and store it into variable(s).
- in echo : `command` → run command
 -          $variable → use variable value
- ┬ ┬ ┬ ┬ ┬
  │ │ │ │ │                            - cronjob explanation. (*/1 * * * * /path/to/script.sh >> /tmp/cron_debug.log 2>&1)(an example to log the output, always use)
  │ │ │ │ └─ Day of week (any)
  │ │ │ └─── Month (4 = April)
  │ │ └───── Day of month (5)
  │ └─────── Hour (0 = midnight)
  └───────── Minute (0)

- | Service        | Default Port | Why                          |
  |----------------|--------------|------------------------------|
  | HTTP           | 80           | Standard web traffic         |
  | HTTPS          | 443          | Encrypted web traffic        |
  | Nginx          | 80 / 443     | Acts as web server           |
  | httpd (Apache) | 80 / 443     | Traditional web server       |
  | Tomcat         | 8080         | Avoids conflict with port 80 |

-  if-else is for conditions, for is for looping over items, and while is for looping until a condition changes.
